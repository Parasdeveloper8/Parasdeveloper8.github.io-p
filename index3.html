      <p id="dp1">I want to share my experience in coding when I 
      started coding there were many difficulties because my age 
      was very low for offline coding classes then i found 
     sololearn on playstore .I started to take classes from 
      sololearn and from mimo also.</p>
        <p id="dp2">My mind was diverting to new 
    technologies to learn.I felt bored in html css and started app 
    development.I did not do app development beacuse i realised 
    that i should focus on web development.within 4 months i 
    completed and learned html css and javascript perfectly.Now i 
    want to master in frontend development as well as backend 
     development and UI also.</p>
